## Installation

### Install with Install Script

To simplify the installation process, you can use the provided [install.sh][install-script] script. This script automates the installation of the Simple Git Shell on your remote Git server. Follow these steps to use the script:

1. **Download the Shell Executable and install script**: Obtain the Simple Git Shell script and the [install.sh][install-script] script by downloading them from the latest release on the [Releases][releases] page of the project's GitHub repository.

2. **Execute the Installation Script**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the [install.sh][install-script] script. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    bash install.sh
    ```

3. **Follow Prompts**: The script will prompt you for the local path to the Simple Git Shell executable and the destination SSH address (in the format user@host). Follow the prompts without specifying where to store the shell script.

Your Simple Git Shell is now installed to `/usr/bin/simple-git-shell` on your remote Git server and ready to use as the default shell for Git users.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to perform the installation manually, you can follow these steps (**you will need to login to the git-server with a `sudoer` user**):

1. **Download the Shell Executable**: Obtain the Simple Git Shell script by downloading the latest release from the [Releases][releases] page on the project's GitHub repository. You will find the executable in the release assets.

2. **Copy the Shell Script to the Server**: Use the following command to copy the downloaded shell script to your Git server:

	```bash
	scp -q "path/to/simple-git-shell" user@host:simple-git-shell
	```

	Replace "path/to/simple-git-shell" with the path to the downloaded executable and the "user@host" with the credentials of your git-server. The `user` should not be the git-user but a `sudoer`.

3. **SSH into the Server**: After copying the shell script, SSH into your Git server using the following command:

	```bash
	ssh user@host
	```

4. **Move the Shell Script**: Once connected to the server, run the following command to move the shell script to the `/usr/bin` directory:

	```bash
	sudo mv -f simple-git-shell "/usr/bin/simple-git-shell"
	```

5. **Change Ownership**: Run the following command to change the ownership of the Simple Git Shell script to `root`:

	```bash
	sudo chown root:root "/usr/bin/simple-git-shell"
	```

	This step is just in case there are some owner issues.

6. **Set as Default Shell for the git user**: Configure the Git user's default shell to use the Simple Git Shell script. Run the following command on the Git server:

    ```bash
    sudo chsh -s "/usr/bin/simple-git-shell" git
    ```

Your Simple Git Shell is now installed, configured as the default shell for Git users, and ready for use on your remote Git server.

### Verify Installation

After the installation, it's important to verify that the Simple Git Shell is correctly installed and working. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
ssh user@host -- --version
```

If you see a version number being returned, the installation is successful. ðŸ¥³

For more information on using the Simple Git Shell, refer to the [Usage](#usage) section in this README.

### Troubleshooting

If the Simple Git Shell script is not automatically marked as executable after the installation with the install script, you may need to make it executable manually using the `chmod` command on the Git server:

```bash
sudo chmod +x "/usr/bin/simple-git-shell"
```

This command ensures that the shell script is made executable.

## Usage

The Simple Git Shell is intended to be used as the default shell for Git users on your Git server. Once configured, Git users can log in using SSH and directly interact with the Simple Git Shell to manage groups, repositories, and SSH access, e.g:

```bash
ssh user@host group list
```

### Simple Git Shell Commands

The Simple Git Shell provides a set of commands to manage your Git server. Users can run these commands with various options to perform specific tasks. To get help on a specific command, you can use the `--help` option, e.g:

```bash
simple-git-shell group list --help
```

#### Group Commands:

```bash
simple-git-shell group <COMMAND>
```
#### List all groups:

```bash
simple-git-shell group list [-b|--base-group]
```

#### Create a new group:

```bash
simple-git-shell group create <group> [-b|--base-group]
```

#### Remove a group:

```bash
simple-git-shell group remove <group> [-b|--base-group]
```

#### Repository Commands:

### Pre-Commit Hooks

To maintain a consistent and organized codebase, we utilize pre-commit hooks that help enforce certain standards and guidelines. These hooks are managed using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) and play a crucial role in ensuring that our commits adhere to a conventional format.

#### Installation

The pre-commit hooks are automatically installed when you run `npm install` in the project directory. There's no need to configure these hooks separately; they will be set up for you.

#### Commit Message Hook (commit-msg)

One of the key pre-commit hooks is the "commit-msg" hook, which checks the format of commit messages to ensure they follow the conventional format defined by [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/config-conventional). By using this pre-commit hook, we ensure that every commit message complies with these standards.

Please make sure that your commits meet these commit message conventions, and if you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us in the issue discussions or through our communication channels.

#### Pre-Commit Code Analysis

To ensure the quality and consistency of our codebase, we perform code analysis using `dotnet build` and the "Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers" NuGet package. This analysis enforces specific coding styles and standards across our project.

### Building

If you make changes to the source code, you can build the project with the following command:

```bash
dotnet build
```

This will compile the project, and you can then execute the generated shell script as described in the [Usage](#usage) section.
